# EasyTotp, TOTP library for C\#

One easy and secure way to communicate between your web application and 
your RestApi services in a micro-service driven architecture is to use a dynamic API-KEY via Time-Based One Time Password algorithm instead of a constant API-Key or even JSON Token. each time that the web application sends a request to any of the 
ResApi servers it will include a new API-Key generated by the TOTP library and on the RestApi side, same library by accessing the same Master-Key will generate the same API-Key to compare with generated API_Key by the web application to authenticate the request.

An easy to use, flexible Time-Based One Time Password library for C# in .Net Core with support for AES encryption.

## Prerequisite

> [Time-Based One Time Password (TOTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm)
>
> [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)

## Resources

> [Github Repository](https://github.com/alicommit-malp/EasyTotp)
>
> [Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EasyTotp/1.0.0)

## Usage

```c#
byte[] Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("12345678901234567890123456789012"); //32 chars
int timeStep = 5; //in seconds
int outputLength = 8;//output digit length
var totp = new EasyTotp.Totp(Key, timeStep, outputLength);
var output = totp.Compute();

//output = 12345678

```

## Usage With Encryption

```c#
byte[] Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("12345678901234567890123456789012"); //32 chars
byte[] AES_Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("12345678901234567890123456789012"); //32 chars
byte[] AES_Iv = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("1234567890123456"); //32 chars

int timeStep = 5; //in seconds
int outputLength = 8;//output digit length
var totp = new EasyTotp.Totp(Key, timeStep, outputLength);

var output = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(totp.ComputeEncrypted(AES_Key,AES_Iv));

//output = F�dm\u0019 ;��\u0016x�\u000esә

```
